import UIKit
UIApplicationMain(CommandLine.argc, UnsafeMutablePointer(CommandLine.unsafeArgv), NSStringFromClass(CustomApplication.self), NSStringFromClass(AppDelegate.self))


/*
 2nd parameter:
 UnsafeMutablePointer(CommandLine.unsafeArgv).bindMemory(to: UnsafeMutablePointer<Int8>.self, capacity: Int(CommandLine.argc))
 This was before Xcode 10

Behind the scenes, this function instantiates the UIApplication object, and the AppDelegate object
 It also:
- loads the Main storyboard file
- creates the app's main window
- sets the storyboard's initial viewcontroller as the window's root viewcontroller
